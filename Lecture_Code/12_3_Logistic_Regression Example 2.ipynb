Accuracy only cares if it is right or not. AUC will include how confident it was that it was right. In other words, if a raisin is Kecimen, a model that predicts a raisin is Kecimen with probability 0.9 will score higher than a model that predicts Kecimen with a probability of 0.6, even though in accuracy they would both score the same."],"metadata":{"id":"CYyRk0E23YHz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n","roc_auc_score(y,mod.predict_proba(scaled_X)[:,1])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xgF8ySdasLOC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702319663778,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":136,"user":{"displayName":"Robert Richardson","userId":"16108946315450400305"}},"outputId":"941cfc29-56e6-47e3-d990-5f8be6290246"},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.7391484946496321"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A confusion matrix can show us how many false negatives and false positives we have.
